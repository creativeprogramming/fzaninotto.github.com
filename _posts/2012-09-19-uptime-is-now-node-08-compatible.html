title: Uptime Is Now Node 0.8 Compatible
published: true
---
<p>I've just released Uptime v1.4 and v2.0rc0. They share the exact same features, but one is for Node 0.6.x, and the second is for Node 0.8.x. Uptime 1.4 is the last release for the old Node, and Uptime 2.0rc0 will become stable as soon as Express goes stable. Both are backwards compatible with previous versions.</p>
<p>All versions are available on <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/node-uptime">npm</a>, or as <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime/tags">tags on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to open issues on the <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime/issues?sort=updated&amp;state=open">GitHub tracker</a> if you find any regression in v2.0 - just don't forget to mention you're on the Node 0.8 version.</p>
