<p>After more than three years working as a CTO at eTF1, I have decided to take a turn and try a new path. And the change is going to be pretty radical: I&rsquo;ll be leaving the Paris region for another region of France, and start a new business on my own. Details are not yet completely finalized, so I can&rsquo;t disclose more about my future work for now, except that it will start on October, 1st. Until then, I will stay at eTF1, which is still a great place to work, managing the technical team, which is still full of extremely competent people.</p>
