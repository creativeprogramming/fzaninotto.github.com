<p>The master branch of the uptime repository now points to version 3, and I just tagged v3.0 on the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime">GitHub repository</a>. This marks the official release of Uptime V3. If you want to know more about this new release, check <a href="http://dotheweb.posterous.com/uptime-v3-is-on-the-way-join-the-beta">the previous post</a>&nbsp;on the subject.</p>

<p>If you have an existing MongoDB database with Uptime 2.0 data, you have to migrate it before starting the application again. It takes a single command:</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&gt; node models/migrations/upgrade2to3</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This is a major milestone for uptime, in usability, performance, and features. I hope you'll love it.</p>
