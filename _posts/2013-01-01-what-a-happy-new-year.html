excerpt: 2013 is beginning the most incredible way. Starting tomorrow, my first two employees will join me to work on a very exciting project. Not only do I get to work early in the product development process, with the methods and tools I like (Node.js, TDD, SCRUM, Lean Startup), I also have the chance to have convinced very talented developers to join the ship.

<p>2013 is beginning the most incredible way. Starting tomorrow, my first two employees will join me to work on a very exciting project. Not only do I get to work early in the product development process, with the methods and tools I like (Node.js, TDD, SCRUM, Lean Startup), I also have the chance to have convinced very talented developers to join the ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Succeeding at building a sustainable business is very satisfactory; it means that I can earn a good living while doing what I truly like. But creating jobs is an entirely new story. Somehow being an entrepreneur wasn't such a fantastic position until this moment, when I stop selling my own expertise to start building something bigger than myself, together with teammates.</p>
<p>That's why I can say at this very moment that a company is born. We form a team of passionate web experts. We promote product innovation, open-source and agile methodologies. We help other companies build new web products and services, find their way through new usages and technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we're still hiring, by the way.</p>
