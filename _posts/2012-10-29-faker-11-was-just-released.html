<p><a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker">Faker</a>, the random data generator for PHP, has recently received some press coverage thanks to a simple tweet from <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>. This brought a lot of traffic and attention to the library, and it became urgent to release a new version. So here it is: version 1.1 packs all bugfixes and enhancements since the original 1.0 release 4 months ago.</p>
